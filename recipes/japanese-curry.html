    <p>Japanese Curry aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs </li>
        <li>¼ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 knob ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>½ apple</li>
        <li>1½ Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.</li>
        <li>Peel the carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it's called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato into quarters (6 pieces for russet potatoes). Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Grate the ginger (I use this grater). You will need 1 tsp of grated ginger, including the juice. Mince the garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).</li>
        <li>Cut the apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.</li>
        <li>Grate the apple. My apple today is a lunchbox apple (smaller than regular), so I used the entire apple (yielded ½ cup or 120 ml grated apple). If your apple is regular size, use ½-¾ apple.</li>
        <li>Cut off the extra fat from the chicken and discard it. Then cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it's called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
